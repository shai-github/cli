In this box are all the words I knowâ€¦
Most of them you will never need, some you will use constantly, 
but with them you may ask all the questions which have never been answered 
and answer all the questions which have never been asked. 

All the great books of the past and all the ones yet to come are made with these words. 
With them there is no obstacle you cannot overcome. 
All you must learn to do is to use them well and in the right places.
